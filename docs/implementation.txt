For the following user story from
4. Back-button behavior
"On the single restaurant screen, tapping the GPS coords on a restaurant closes the current screen
and returns to the map screen, selecting that restaurant and showing the small pop-up info
about the restaurant."

Changed implementation to show pop up info window to
tapping the GPS coords return to the map screen and
- have the map show just one marker (for the restaurant in question).
- hide (remove?) the cluster markers and show the one restaurant marker.
- When the user taps out of this info window (a tap event, on the map) have the app show the
  rest of the clusters once again.
